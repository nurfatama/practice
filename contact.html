    Aurora borealis is far from a new phenomenon. The spectacle of the northern lights is described by early storytellers and has given rise to many legends. Symbols linked to the northern lights are for instance found on the Sami shamanistic drum. The phenomenon has several different names in Sami,
	amongst them “Guovssahas” which means “the light which can be heard”. It’s poetry in motion.
    During the Viking Age, the northern lights were said to be the armour of the Valkyrie warrior virgins, 
	that shed a strange flickering light. Today, locals are often respectfully referring to the northern lights as “the green lady”. 
	Just check the colours in the numerous photos and films of the lights posted on social media. You might see many more nuances in real life, though.
